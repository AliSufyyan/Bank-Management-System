The Bank Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ designed to handle the fundamental operations of a bank. This includes user registration, login, account management, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. The system is intended to streamline the basic banking processes and maintain secure and efficient handling of user data.

•	Provide a secure login mechanism for users.
•	Allow users to register and create new accounts.
•	Enable users to deposit and withdraw money.
•	Provide an interface for admins to view all account holders.
•	Implement a mechanism for deleting user accounts.
